*This is an archived version, the current version is [here](/podcast-trackers-by-episode-share/).*

Now that we have a good idea of [which podcast hosts are producing new podcast episodes](/podcast-hosts-by-episode-share),
let's turn our attention to third-party podcast analytics services.

These services are typically provided by a company that is not the podcast host, but can provide tracking and analytics 
by being specified as the underlying media file url, which then redirects back to the host.  Sometimes, these services
are implemented as custom prefixes (taking the original media url and adding a prefix to it), but not always.

By intercepting every episode media file request, these analytics services can provide a view that is potentially larger than
what the underlying podcast host analytics can provide.

Podtrac, one of the most popular services, released some 
[interesting data about their US download figures for September 2021](https://podnews.net/article/podtrac-us-downloads-and-users-sep21).

But how representative of the entire podcast world is this data?  How many podcasters use services like these?

We already did the work of analyzing _every single new podcast episode published_ (about 1.8 million in November 2024), 
[identifying which podcast hosting company it belongs to](/podcast-hosts-by-episode-share).

We used the actual media file url (past any tracking redirects) to identify the host
instead of the feed url domain, which can often undercount hosts that offer custom domains.

Let's now take a look at the tracking services themselves.  Of the new episodes that were published in November, how many
of them included one or more of these tracking services?  Some episodes had as many as *ten* of these redirecting trackers!

*Note we can only observe "client-side" trackers. There are other podcast analytics services 
such as {{< a "https://www.tritondigital.com/solutions/audience-measurement" "Triton Digital" >}} that receive private request logs 
directly from partner hosts. Like first-party podcast host analytics, the reach of these services is not measurable in a public
way, and thus not included in this analysis. Some services like [Podtrac](https://analytics.podtrac.com/) provide both client-side and log-based measurement,
only their client-side prefix-based measurement is available for public observation here.*

{{< details "_March 2024: Spreaker data_" >}}
_Starting early March, we gained a better signal of when Spreaker releases new episodes, so our crawlers are finding more. This more accurate view seems to have helped Podtrac and Adswizz the most._

{{< details "_September 2023: Spotify for Creators data_" >}}
_Starting mid-September, we gained a better signal of when Spotify for Creators (formerly Spotify for Podcasters, formerly Anchor) podcasts release new episodes, so our crawlers are finding more.
Higher share of new episodes on S4P (which typically do not have prefixes) will have led to lower share overall._

First, a quick chart of the top podcast tracking services over time, based on share of new episodes every month.

{{< a "https://analytics.podtrac.com/" "Podtrac" >}} and {{< a "https://chartable.com/" "Chartable" >}} are the clear top two trackers of new podcast episodes.

Now let's graph the same data again, excluding them to see the others more clearly.

Analysis by [John Spurlock](https://twitter.com/johnspurlock)

Thanks to the [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/) and other sources, for giving us signals of when 
to check for new episodes in public podcasts.

And thanks to the [Open Podcast Analytics Working Group](https://github.com/opawg) for maintaining a list of media url patterns and analytics services patterns.
We've incorporated these patterns along with some of our own to come up with the host and analytics service identification and metadata for this ranking.
